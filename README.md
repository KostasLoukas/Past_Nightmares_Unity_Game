# Past Nightmares (Unity Game)
Past Nightmares is a game about a young boy, James, whose life changes drastically after the arrival of a very specific letter for his father...

Living in the age of war between his country and others, James struggles to cope with the emotional trauma that the world has brought him into, trying desperately to fight the demons that haunt his dreams.

This game is a demo and was created for a thesis in a collaboration project with another department of my university. This game is not to be taken seriously and is only a prototype of an idea that my partner and I came together to show off. There are no plans to develop it further whatsoever, though the plot is written and planned out on its whole, so if any person does want to see it fully released, we may do just that. :)
